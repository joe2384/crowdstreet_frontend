# Crowdstreet Take-Home
> This take-home is an app to filter restaurants by state, genre, and attire. The app also uses an input field to search restaurants by name, city, and genre. The app has pagination to help keep table rows to no more than ten listings. This app features React, Typescript, Redux, Enzyme, and Jest.

## Project features

* Landing Page
* The initial page should show a simple form with inputs for the following field:
* Form requirements
    - Investment Amount (Currency)
    - Investment Type (Text) eg. “Bond”, “Stocks”, “Real Estate” etc...
    - Total Net Worth (Currency)
    - User Estimated Yearly Income (Currency)
    - User Estimated Credit Score (Number from 300-850)

These fields are all required and should validate to type. Provide feedback to the
user when they are incorrect or missing information. There should be space for marketing copy
(Lorum Ipsem) and controls for moving forward.
